# In progress: NLP & NEO4j Python demo

## Python application that takes documents and performs NLP analysis on them, loading the results into Neo4j. 


### Todo:

* There is a bug where you need to run the script twice to completely populate the Graph. I think I am using Neo4j Sessions improperly...
* Dockerize the Application to package all of the dependencies


## to run

python3 ./main.py
